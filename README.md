# rsed - A very rusty sed implementation

This application is a very naive implementation of sed done using Rust. This is just an exercise to practice and learn rust, so I don't expect it to be nearly as powerful as sed.

## Implemented features
+ Substitution with the g, p and, c and w commands
+ Range by number and/or regular expressions
+ -n, -f and -e flags
