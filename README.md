# rsed - A very rusty sed implementation

This application is a very naive implementation of sed done using Rust. This is just an exercise to practice and learn rust, so I don't expect it to be nearly as powerful as sed.

## Implemented features
+ Substitution with the g and p commands (only one file as of now)
+ Line number an range restriction
+ -n and -e flags
